# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener doesn't always fire consistently, leading to issues in updating UI and data based on authentication status.  The `inconsistentAuth.js` file shows the problematic implementation, while `fixedAuth.js` demonstrates a robust approach to handling such situations.

## Bug Description
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is crucial for responding to authentication status changes. However, under conditions like network latency or quick successions of authentication events, this listener might fail to trigger, resulting in an inconsistent user experience and potential data corruption.

## Solution
The provided solution utilizes a combination of error handling and more deliberate state management techniques.  It leverages a dedicated function to handle the authentication state transition, enhancing responsiveness and consistency.
